## Device Bugs & Quirks

There's no good place to quickly search for weird HTML, CSS, and JS quirks in mobile devices. I'll try and list mine here.

Please feel free to add any legitimate non-framework-specific issues to this tracker. If the issue deals with a browser in active development, please file the issue with that browser's tracker as well. 

This site gives more information on that: [http://movethewebforward.org/](http://movethewebforward.org/)

Of particular interest here are bugs in older platforms that are no longer being developed, but still come included on brand new devices - and often have no update path! Android 2.x WebKit quirks are a prime example.
